# cli-chatgpt

A Swift CLI application written in Swift that interacts with the ChatGPT AI model.

## Installation

You can install the app using `homebrew` for macOS, `directly from GitHub` source code or from a `direct download`.

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install henriquestiagoo/homebrew-tap/cli-chatgpt
```

### Direct Download

For a quick and easy installation without compiling, you can directly download the pre-built binary for your operating system:

#### macOS

```shell
curl -L -o chatgpt https://github.com/henriquestiagoo/cli-chatgpt/releases/download/v1.0.2/v1.0.2.tar.gz && chmod +x chatgpt && sudo mv chatgpt /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows

Download [the binary](https://github.com/henriquestiagoo/cli-chatgpt/releases/download/v1.0.2/v1.0.2.exe.zip) and add it to your PATH.

### Manually

A new GitHub release is created each time a new version is available. You can download the latest version of the executable directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/henriquestiagoo/cli-chatgpt/releases).

## Usage

The application communicates with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to make use of the ChatGPT AI model. Note you must have an API key (either free or pay-as-you-go) to make requests to the API. You can check your available API Keys [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

```bash
chatgpt <message to be interpreted by the OpenAI model> --apikey <api-key>
```

## Uninstallation

If for any reason you wish to uninstall the ChatGPT CLI application from your system, you can do so by removing the binary:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/chatgpt
```
